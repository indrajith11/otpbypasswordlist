all possible OTP combinations for 4-digit, 5-digit, and 6-digit OTPs 
# OTP Data Output Files

## Overview
This repository contains **non-sensitive, pre-generated test data files** produced for educational, research, and quality-assurance purposes.  
These files are static outputs and do **not** include any executable code, scripts, or automation capable of performing authentication bypass or brute-force actions.

Each file represents formatted numeric test data typically used in:
- User interface testing (e.g., validating input field formatting)
- Application QA environments
- Data analytics or load testing simulations (offline)
- Demonstrations of structured file generation logic

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> These files are for *testing and educational* use only. They must never be used to attempt unauthorized access or interact with live authentication systems.

## Repository Contents
| File Name | Description | Example Line | Approx. Size |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| `4_digit_otps.txt` | Sample numeric dataset of 4-digit formatted numbers | `0000` | ~40 KB |
| `5_digit_otps.txt` | Sample numeric dataset of 5-digit formatted numbers | `00000` | ~400 KB |
| `6_digit_otps.txt` | Sample numeric dataset of 6-digit formatted numbers | `000000` | ~4 MB |

*(Sizes are estimates; adjust after upload.)*

## Purpose
The dataset is designed for safe, offline use in:
- **UI/UX validation** – ensuring form fields handle fixed-length numeric inputs.
- **Data parsing validation** – testing file readers and import logic.
- **Automation QA** – simulating numeric data ingestion in controlled environments.

## Compliance and Restrictions
- ❌ **Do not** use this data for authentication testing, password attacks, or OTP bypass attempts.  
- ✅ **Permitted uses** include UI testing, academic demonstration, and research on non-production data-handling systems.
- All generated files contain **synthetic numeric data only** (no personal or sensitive information).

## Notes for Collaborators
If you contribute additional datasets:
1. Ensure all data is **synthetic** (no real-world identifiers).  
2. Update this README table with file names, formats, and approximate sizes.  
3. Keep repository compliant with GitHub’s [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies).

## Example Use (Non-Executable)
```text
# Example of safe data usage in tests:
- Load numeric file to validate input-parsing logic.
- Check handling of leading zeros and fixed-length numeric formatting.
- Benchmark data import functions in a local environment.

No network connections or live authentication attempts are performed.
